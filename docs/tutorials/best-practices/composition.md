# Composition

Composition is another fundemental concept in OOP that combines objects or data types into more complex ones.
This implements a *has-a* relationship between objects, rather than *is-a* from [Inheritance](../advanced/inheritance.md).

For example, let's imagine a coffee machine. This coffee machine **has a** grinder, a brewer, and many other components, but the coffee machine itself *is not one of them*.
